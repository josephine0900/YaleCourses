Notes for Santorini:

Spaces:
- Build a dome on level 3; used to block the other player from standing on the dome
- dome makes a building a level 4

Workers:
- Workers cannot move onto a space that is already occupied
- Can move only 1 level higher than the current space
- Cannot move onto a dome/level 4

Players:
- Do we have to check if any of the player's workers are on level 3 spaces or just the current player's workers
